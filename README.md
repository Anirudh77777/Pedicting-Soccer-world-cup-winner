World Cup Match Prediction

Overview
This repository contains Python code for simulating and predicting match outcomes for the FIFA World Cup. The prediction model is based on machine learning techniques, particularly logistic regression, trained on historical match data.
Features
•	Match Simulation: Simulates matches for each group in the World Cup tournament.
•	Outcome Prediction: Predicts match outcomes (win, lose, draw) using a logistic regression model.
•	Point Calculation: Calculates points earned by each team based on match outcomes.
•	Visualization: Visualizes match predictions and outcomes.
Usage
1.	Requirements: Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib).
2.	Data Preparation: Prepare historical match data and team rankings for training the model.
3.	Training: Train the logistic regression model on historical match data.
4.	Simulation: Simulate matches for the World Cup tournament using the trained model.
5.	Analysis: Analyze match predictions, outcomes, and points earned by each team.
Files
•	data: Folder containing historical match data and team rankings.
